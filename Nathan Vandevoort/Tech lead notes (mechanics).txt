Sword Mechanics - only deals damage once sword passes through enemy
Flies Damage - only deal damage on each new hit not a constant damage
Flie pathing - two flies that move left and right (one at the beginning one at the end) One fly that moves in a rectangle formation after the first fly that moves left and right. 
After the fly that flies in a rectangle there are 2 flies that fly vertically up and down at the same rate. Finally there is a very large "king fly" which goes left and right
Player damage - each fly does about 10.666 percent of the players health bar.
King fly damage- is the same as normal fly's 
Fly's release a green particle effect
When flys die they turn into a glowing dissapating white powder.
Wind mill wheel idea.
