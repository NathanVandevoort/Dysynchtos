Wind mill wheel idea.
Wind mill uses the rotating wheel mechanic with an if statement saying that if the speed at which the wheel spins rotates too fast it will reset. 

Flies:
-Fly's release a green particle effect out of there back sides
-When flys die they turn into a glowing dissapating white powder.
-King fly damage is the same as normal fly's 
-Player damage each fly does about 10.666 percent of the players health bar.
-Fly pathing - two flies that move left and right (one at the beginning one at the end) One fly that moves in a rectangle formation after the first fly that moves left and right. 
After the fly that flies in a rectangle there are 2 flies that fly vertically up and down at the same rate. Finally there is a very large "king fly" which goes left and right
-Flies Damage only deal damage on each new hit not a constant damage
-Flies have a health bar 2 hits per normal fly with the king fly taking 8 hits.


Left right fly = 1
Square fly = 2
Up down fly = 3
King fly = 4

Order of flies: 1 2 3 3 1 4



Sword:
-Sword only deals damage once sword contacts twice. 


Dummy:
-takes 8 hits


Player:
-Both player and sword face toward mouse cursor on the X axis however only the sword faces toward the mouse cursor on both X and Y axis.

Notes:
- grass sounds starts once characters stop moving
- One tree in the center is transparent yet infront of one of the flies.
- Camera drifts depending on which direction character is facing making the character take up only about the side third of the camera.
